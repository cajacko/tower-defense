# Project Canvas

## Process

When coming to work on this project follow these steps:

- Update an prioritise everything in the canvas
- Tackle the top most uncertainty that you can work on right now, or carry on if already in progress
  - Normally involves making a change to the product and testing how it changes
- Repeat

## Problem

_What's the problem?_

Tower defense games are super awesome, co-operative games are also fun. But there is a severe lack of co-operative tower defense board games. Maybe for a good reason, but let's find out

### Existing Alternatives

_How else are people solving this problem right now?_

- Everything here: https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/141754/tower-defense-games

## Solution

_How are you solving the problems? Add a link to the latest place to find the current solution_

A co-operative tower defense game for at least 2 players, with a bunch of different maps/scenarios and a legacy component to it. To make it feel more like a story.

### High Level Concept

_Describe the solution in a few words that anyone could understand_

A co-operative tower defense game

### Unique Value Proposition

_What's unique about this solution?_

- Co-op tower defense board game
- Legacy component to it

## Uncertainties

_What are you most uncertain about? Prioritise this list and add potential tests to help us become more certain_

- **Current play tests have resulted in turns were you just wait, there's nothing useful to do. How do we tackle this?** _(Getting heroes to pick up the rewards helps, but more ideas and play testing needs to happen)_
- **How to end the game on a high? It's a bit of an anticlimax if you defeat the hard bit and then a few stragglers are left**
- **What's the right balance of hits/damage/dice for good level of difficulty**
- **What are good types of towers to have**
- **How much variation is needed for towers, bad guys, abilities etc. To feel like there's enough unique scenarios to play**
- **Is there enough uncertainty and player agency to make every phase throughout a game compelling**
- **How can you add a compelling narrative/story layer to the game** _(Brainstorm methods and play test, thinking more about legacy atm)_
- **How to increase player co-operation and engagement, rather than playing a solo player game by taking it in turns**
  - Having players control a single hero/engineer who is responsible for building towers, upgrading them, fixing them and slowing down/attacking bad guys (Done)
  - Need to play and brainstorm more ways of doing this until it starts to feel right. (Done, but could do more)
  - May need to add specific hero abilities and customisations to make it feel like you are doing something unique and useful (Need to try this)
- **What's the best way to deal with maps? Book of fun custom maps (A3/folded), or tiles to put together?**
