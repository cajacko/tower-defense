## Process

When coming to work on this project follow these steps:

- Update an prioritise everything in the canvas
- Tackle the top most uncertainty that you can work on right now, or carry on if already in progress
  - Normally involves making a change to the product and testing how it changes
- Repeat

## Problem

_What's the problem?_

Tower defense games are super awesome, co-operative games are also fun. But there is a severe lack of co-operative tower defense board games. Maybe for a good reason, but let's find out

## Solution

_How are you solving the problems? Add a link to the latest place to find the current solution_

A co-operative tower defense game with ever changing maps and scenarios. With some kind of narrative or legacy basis to it.

### High Level Concept

_Describe the solution in a few words that anyone could understand_

A co-operative tower defense game

### Unique Value Proposition

_What's unique about this solution?_

- Co-op tower defense board game
- No fixed map
- Narrative/legacy component to it

## Uncertainties

_What are you most uncertain about? Prioritise this list and add potential tests to help us become more certain_

- **How can you add a compelling narrative/story layer to the game** _(Brainstorm methods and play test)_
- **How to increase player co-operation and engagement, rather than playing a solo player game by taking it in turns** 
- **What are good types of towers to have**
- **How to end the game on a high? It's a bit of an anticlimax if you defeat the hard bit and then a few stragglers are left**
- **How many bad guys in one space is fun/optimal? Hordes can be fun, but then need to manage lots of miniatures**
- **What's the right balance of hits/damage/dice for good level of difficulty**
- **What's the best way to deal with maps? Book of fun custom maps (A3/folded), or tiles to put together?**
