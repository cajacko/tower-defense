# Development Notes

- Multiple spawn zones could be fun
- Upgrade heroes or attach abilities to them
- Some heroes are better at building certain towers than others?
- Some spaces can only have certain towers there?
- There are multiple gate dice, so that we can include the ability to heal the gate. But you can never get new dice. So if one goes down to 0 you are permanently down a dice.
- Include legacy components
- The current plan for the maps is to have them all in a A4 ring binder, when you play you open the spread so each map is A3. In this way we can design some really cool ones, and have stickers for people to make legacy changes.
